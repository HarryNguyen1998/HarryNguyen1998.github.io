          Welcome to my page, where I posted about projects I have finished or are currently in
          progress. Hopefully you will enjoy your stay here!

          My name is Quan Minh Hong Nguyen, a vietnamese who is studying at Vaasa University of Applied Sciences,
          Information Technology Bachelor degree.

          I like Programming because it's very close to magic: using some weird rune syntax, you
          conjure a scroll, and if it fits with the govering law, things appear out of nowhere.
          Also, after a long day of solving problems, I like to chill down, either with sauna or
          games. I like a lot of games, but these titles are my all time favorite:

        <p>
          <code>Omori, Divinity: Original Sin 2, Yu-Gi-Oh!, CS:GO, Elden Ring, Tale of Immortal</code>
        </p>

          I'd love to <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?view=cm&fs=1&to=harrynguyen719@gmail.com&tf=1">chat</a>
            about job opportunities, projects, sauna, games or whatever is on your mind.
